Erases all contacts and photos from an iOS device.

Apple did a nice thing when they rolled out iOS 8.  The simulator, when reset, now contains a set of sample photos and also a set of sample contacts.  These work great.  It was sure a pain coming up with your own each time.

This saves a lot of headaches when testing out import features, at least usually.
However, sometimes you really do want these things cleared out.  If you've ever gone through that process, you don't want to have to do it again.

This utility gets your permission (the first time!), then torches the entire contents of the simulator/device's photo album AND address book.  It defaults to asking on launch, though the buttons can trigger it again.

I'm not distributing this as an app because not only would Apple not approve it, but there'd be a bunch of tragedies where people wiped out data they later decided they wanted to hold on to.  Do us both a favor and limit your use of this app to simulator and test devices only where you aren't using any data you would miss.

This uses the MIT license.  If someone from Apple wants to make this an option in the next version simulator and that makes this obsolete, I'd be thrilled.  Maybe they could also add Cmd-R to the Reset Content and Settingsâ€¦ option, which I use literally 25+ times a day.  Seriously, Apple..
